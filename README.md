# Models

Here you can find the codes and files for my two actual models : PCH (piecewise constant baseline hazard) and MNPP (multinomial probit model). Note the second one is not operational for use but is a good pedagogic tool.

If you want to use PCH and have any problem with it please contact me and I will fix it quickly.
